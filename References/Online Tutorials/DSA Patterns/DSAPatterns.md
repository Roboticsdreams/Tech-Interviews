Rearrange the above 15 topics in priority order
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Hereâ€™s a priority order for the 15 data structure and algorithm topics, tailored for coding interviews, especially for companies like FAANG, based on the frequency and versatility of the patterns:

Priority Order for Interview Preparation:
Two Pointers
Commonly used for problems involving arrays and linked lists. Essential for problems like searching, sorting, and finding pairs or triplets.

Sliding Window
Very useful for array and string problems involving subarrays or substrings, where you need to optimize space and time complexity.

Graph Problems
Fundamental for solving problems related to traversal (DFS/BFS), shortest paths, and cycles, which frequently appear in interviews.

Greedy Algorithms
Frequently tested due to their ability to simplify complex optimization problems (e.g., intervals, scheduling, and greedy selections).

Tree Problems
Understanding tree traversal, binary search trees, and balanced trees is essential. Problems involving DFS/BFS are common.

Intervals
Interval problems are frequent in interviews, particularly in scenarios involving scheduling, merging intervals, and meeting rooms.

Top/Least K Elements
Important for heap-based problems and selection algorithms. Kth largest/smallest elements are frequently tested.

In-Place Operations
Often seen in array-based questions, where optimizing space complexity is critical.

Permutations/Subsets
Backtracking problems often come up for problems that involve permutations, combinations, and subsets.

Recursion-Banned Problems
These include recursion-converted-to-iteration, which is useful when recursion exceeds limits or for optimizing recursion space complexity.

Maximum/Minimum Subarrays
Subarrays and dynamic programming problems, such as Kadaneâ€™s algorithm, are important for optimizing sums and finding extremes in arrays.

Linked Lists
Key operations such as reversing, cycle detection, and merging lists appear frequently in interviews, though they are more specific than arrays.

Sorted Arrays
Binary search is crucial but may be easier to master compared to other more versatile patterns like two pointers or sliding windows.

Common String Problems
Problems on strings can involve various techniques, but typically require understanding basic data structures like hashmaps or tries.

Bit Manipulation
This is useful but tends to be a niche area. Bit manipulation problems appear less frequently but can be important for low-level optimizations.
